                <h2>I am an Italian student passionate about computer science. Iâ€™ve explored various areas of computer science to get a broad view and figure out my specialization. I started with Java, then moved to C++ with debugging tools like GDB and Ghidra to understand code internally. I wrote small x64 Assembly programs to deepen my low-level knowledge. I also studied networking basics to understand packet operations. Now, when coding, I usually have an idea of where bugs might originate from.</h2>

                <h2>I've been using Linux as my main OS for years and know it well. Iâ€™m comfortable using it on servers, as I do that often. I even developed a tool to map a program's memory.</h2>

                <h2>$ Java/Kotlin</h2>
                <h2>I used these languages for game-related projects, where I created an entire game mode using Spigot APIs. I handled world restoration, stats, cosmetics, and arena management.</h2>

                <h2>Iâ€™ve had multiple low-level programming experiences, starting with C++ and debugging with tools like GDB, Ghidra, and x64Debugger. I can analyze x64 Assembly code and write programs that handle memory management.</h2>
